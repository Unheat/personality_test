# Lab 1 Report: Personality Factors
## Name 1, Name 2, Name 3
## Date: 

## Introduction
In a few sentences, describe what you built at a high level and why. It is okay to draw on the project instructions, but do not copy sentences word for word.

## Problem Statement
Describe the main problems that you needed to solve to implement this project. In particular, define the main goals of the project in terms of inputs and outputs. Then describe how you decomposed the high level problem and how you planned to connect your solutions to achieve the overall project goals.


## Solution
Describe the algorithms you used to solve the problems and subproblems you defined above. You do not need to write a step by step algorithm for each function you wrote, just the key ideas behind how you implemented each major part of your solution.

## Reflections

### Challenges
Briefly discuss any of the following: what challenges did you encounter in the completion of this project, technical, collaborative, or otherwise, and how did you overcome them?  

### Achievements
What are you most proud of about what you built in this lab? What directions might you want to explore further from this project?

### Takeaways
How did your previous knowledge and/or experiences help you with this project? What are three lessons learned that you can take from this lab?

### Ethical Reflection
Run your program and take the survey yourselves. Do you feel like the results reflect your actual personalities? What kinds of shortcomings do you see?

Next, write a paragraph discussing the potential opportunities and risks of using technology to assess people's personalities. Think beyond interactive surveys like the one you built. For example, you might consider the use of algorithms to quantify personality factors using different kinds of personal data. Feel free to explore and pull from external sources, as long as you cite them clearly.


## Contribution Statement
Describe how each partner contributed to the work of this project. It is perfectly acceptable (and recommended) to describe how you actually worked together on all aspects of the project instead of dividing it and working separately, e.g. developing the algorithms together or pair programming. If so, try to think about what each of you brought to that process, e.g. Alice had the breakthrough about how to reverse scores, or Zheng's background in psychology helped us understand the problem.
